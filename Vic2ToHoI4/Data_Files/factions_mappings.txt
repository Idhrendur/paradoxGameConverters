# Format as "link = { culture = french ideology = democratic faction = french_entente_alliance } "
# It means that if a French-cultured faction converting to a democracy leads a faction, ...
# ...said faction will be coded as french_entente_alliance, whose localisation is already in vanilla
# The order of the factions decides, as if there are two French democracies leading factions, ...
# ...the first would get the french_entente_alliance, the second the more fallbackish "allies"
# "any" can be used as key for culture (meaning open to anyone)
# "any" can be used as key for ideology (meaning it can be of any ideology)
# The "culture" refers to a culture group.
# The "ideology" refers to HoI4 ruling party
# The fallback at last is used if no appropriate is found
