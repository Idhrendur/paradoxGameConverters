 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "Gathering Storm"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Dark times are coming. The world's great powers are on the verge of a Great War, different from any before. Meanwhile, colonialism seems to be at its end, slowly giving place to commerce. Political differences between countries are slowly erupting, with the world been doused in gasoline. A single spark may be all it takes."
 NEUTRALITY_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Although the world has been shaked by political differences and revolts, some few states have managed to don't be influenced by it. \n\n The population is hostile to armed conflict but the world is falling and the country needs to be defended."
 DEMOCRATIC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Liberty, Equality and Fraternity. This is the motto. Democracy has managed to spread and evolve from the Ancient civilizations who first mastered it. \n\n Pacifism rules the country, trying to preserve the status quo, but with tyrannical regimes planning to expand, fights will have to come."
 FASCISM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Third Way, or Fascism, is a hideous ideology. It uses leftist rhetoric, while being enemy to communism. There are many ways of fascism, all similar in an aspect: the hatred against any outsider. \n\n The military of fascism is full of young men, all willing to die for the cause of fascism and they all need some land to rest in, maybe neighbouring ones currently ruled by those outsiders."
 COMMUNISM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Karl Marx published the Communist Manifesto in the 19th century. Since then, his ideals were seen as an utopia by some, who managed to take control of governments. Rapid industrialization and collectivization followed, often at a great cost in human lives. \n\n Threat from capitalism is still near and fascists won't wait a second to destroy communism. It is time the Great Red Army fixes the situation, finally destroying the menace of capitalism."
 RADICAL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Minarchism, based on the Non-Aggression Principle, lets individuals have the most possible economic autonomy from the State. Rivers of money flow throughout the country, even if only few ones benefit from them. \n\n Communism, the first enemy of the capitalistic society, is planning for the destruction of the keynesian society. The NAP can be suspended for a little time, just enough for the soldiers to destroy the threat of socialism."
 ABSOLUTIST_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The State is the Supreme Leader and the Supreme Leader is the State. These are the words of the absolutist regime ruling. Unrest has been finally destroyed, sacrificing most of the country's manpower. \n\n The new ideas coming from outside are trying to wage war to destroy each other. This may look not related to us, but once they will have ended with each other, they will surely pointing against the Supreme Leader."
 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the last conflicts, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
